          cultivate medical care and education to places which lack these

          force of change, driven by a mission to extend vital medical care and
          knowledge to the farthest corners of the globe. The WHAT team stands
          resolute in our commitment to reaching underserved communities,
          ensuring they receive the care they deserve. We go beyond conventional
          aid, contributing essential medical equipment and resources to fortify
          the healthcare infrastructure. But our mission doesn't end there. We
          strive to cultivate a brighter future through educational programs,

          Embark on a journey with the dedicated and passionate members of the
          WHAT medical team, united by a profound commitment to combating venous
          disease. These individuals first crossed paths during their invaluable
          contributions to Honduras Vein Week, an annual medical mission
          sponsored by the Hackett Hemwall Patterson Foundation (HHPF). Dr. Bui
          and A. Greenberg had already been championing advanced vascular care
          in Vietnam, while Dr. McHutchison and T. Zimmerman were busy
          establishing year-round follow-up clinics in Honduras, specifically
          for those enduring severe leg ulcers. What binds the WHAT team
          together is not just their shared expertise but a profound sense of
          purposeâ€”an unwavering dedication to provide continuous vascular/venous
          care to the underserved. Beyond this noble cause, they are driven by a
          burning desire to elevate medical education in these nations. Their
          collective passion and vision have given birth to WHAT, a unique force
          poised to make a transformative impact on the world.
