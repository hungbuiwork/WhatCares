            <p className=' text-left indent-8'> [Update this] The WHAT medical team members, who all share a common interest in treating venous disease, were brought together over the past several years while donating their time and expertise to Honduras Vein Week, an annual medical mission trip sponsored by the Hackett Hemwall Patterson Foundation (HHPF).  Additionally, Dr. Bui and A. Greenberg were already active in bringing advanced vascular care to Vietnam, while Dr. McHutchison and T. Zimmerman where formulating year-round follow up clinics in Honduras for those suffering from severe leg ulcers. The WHAT team’s common passion for continuous vascular / venous care to the unserved, combined with their desire to advance medical education in those countries launched the unique world vision in WHAT.  </p>
