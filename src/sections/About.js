            The origins of WHAT trace back to the dedicated and passionate
            members of our medical team. Their journey began as they came
            together during their involvement in Honduras Vein Week, an annual
            medical mission sponsored by the Hackett Hemwall Patterson
            Foundation (HHPF). Notably, Dr. Bui and A. Greenberg were already
            championing advanced vascular care in Vietnam, while Dr. McHutchison
            and T. Zimmerman were actively establishing year-round follow-up
            clinics in Honduras, with a specific focus on aiding those enduring
            severe leg ulcers. What truly binds the WHAT team is not only their
            shared expertise but also a profound sense of purpose, marked by an
            unwavering commitment to provide continuous vascular/venous care to
            underserved communities. Beyond this noble cause, they share a
            passionate drive to enhance medical education in these nations. It
            is this collective dedication and vision that brought WHAT into
            existence, as a unique force poised to make a transformative impact
            on global healthcare.
